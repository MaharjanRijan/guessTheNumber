# Guess the Number Game

Welcome to the **Guess the Number** game repository! This is a simple number guessing game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It challenges users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a specified number of attempts.

## About the Game

In this game, the user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. The game will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The user has a maximum of **6 attempts** to guess the number correctly. The game also provides a hint by narrowing down the possible range of numbers based on previous guesses.

The goal of the game is to guess the correct number in the least number of attempts. If the player guesses correctly, a success message is displayed. If the player fails to guess the correct number within the allowed attempts, the game ends, and the correct number is revealed.
